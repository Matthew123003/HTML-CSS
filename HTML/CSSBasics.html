        <p>
            This is just here for some styling. I am doing a tutorial to learn CSS and in the video they had a 
            paragraph tag with a bunch of text in it. I wont make mine as long as thiers but I wanted to have something
            similar to what they had to follow along.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h2>DOING THIS FOR A JOB</h2>
            <p>
                Once again making another section with a paragraph to match what the video has so that way I have the 
                same setup they do to learn CSS.
            </p>
