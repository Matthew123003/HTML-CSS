                idjdu duas ddu d doa dsajs. Nonesense, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense, words over and over and over and over
                and over and over and over and over and over and over again. This is jsut here to follow along wiht what the
                lessong has setup at the beinning. THe stuff beofre was me pretending to type like I was in the movies. I
                learned to type by playing a game called edge of darkness whcih was a multi user dungeon  when i was younger
                i dont use homerow or anyhting but i can type pretty quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the last paragraph. It actually is faster for me to type things in my head that actaully are real
                thigns instead of trying to type gibberish or fake type like in the movies. What I do though i dont worry as
                much about accurcy ahile im typing this stuff, but still trying to type out a coherent message with words
                arent too diffcult to spell or type or anyhting like that.
            </p>

                Were going to talk about selectors and classes more in CSS. Missed this paragraph. The video has 4 so I
                figured why not lets add a fourth one.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="error">
            A new div that has an error class so all the CSS error stylings will affect both.
        </div>
